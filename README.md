# Paper_viscoelastic_ARPE19
This repository contains the experimental curves of the Lp/Rp and Rc/Rp ratios for the cells used in the article *"Mechanical characterization and visco-hyperelastic modeling of epithelial cells: Pressure-rate dependency of the apparent elastic modulus."*, as well as the mechanical properties determined for each experiment.
